Used multilinear regression algorithm to build the model
distance from city center, no of rooms, size are given to x, Price is given to y
training data score = 0.94806, testing data score = 0.93699, since the difference is very less, there is no problem of Overfitting and underfitting.
In model evaluation RMSE Score =33.434, R2 Score= 0.936
Saved the model using pickle and also can be saved by using Joblib
